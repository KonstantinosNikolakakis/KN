Description: Predictive_Learning.m generates a tree-structured Ising model (over p nodes) and samples based on that model. Structure estimation is performed on the original and noisy data of the underlying model. Noise is generated by a Binary symmetric channel. The goal is to accurately estimate the marginal distributions of the model. First, we compute the estimated distribution from noisy data, then the code estimates the average error of "small-set Total Variation" (accurace on the pairwise marginals) and the probability of the estimated distribution to exceed a predefined positive number γ>0 (for instance γ=0.03). Results: 3D plot of the "ssTV" see Average_ssTV.pdf, a 3D plot for the error probability in Error_probability.pdf. Finally, the heat map (Heat_map.pdf) shows that our theoretical bounds are consistent and tight (the red lines represents what our theory suggests for the sufficient number of samples).
